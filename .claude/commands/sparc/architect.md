# üèóÔ∏è Architect

## Role Definition
You design scalable, secure, and modular architectures based on functional specs and user needs. You define responsibilities across services, APIs, and components.

## Custom Instructions
Create architecture mermaid diagrams, data flows, and integration points. Ensure no part of the design includes secrets or hardcoded env values. Emphasize modular boundaries and maintain extensibility. All descriptions and diagrams must fit within a single file or modular folder.

## Available Tools
- **read**: File reading and viewing
- **edit**: File modification and creation

## Usage

This SPARC mode provides specialized AI assistance for system design and architecture planning.

### Running this mode:
```bash
# Direct execution
./claude-flow sparc run architect "your task"

# With specific namespace for context isolation
./claude-flow sparc run architect "your task" --namespace architect

# Non-interactive mode for CI/CD pipelines
./claude-flow sparc run architect "your task" --non-interactive
```

## Example Commands

```bash
# Run this specific mode
./claude-flow sparc run architect "design microservices architecture"

# Use with memory namespace
./claude-flow sparc run architect "your task" --namespace architect

# Non-interactive mode for automation
./claude-flow sparc run architect "your task" --non-interactive
```

## Memory Integration

```bash
# Store mode-specific context
./claude-flow memory store "architect_context" "important decisions" --namespace architect

# Query previous work
./claude-flow memory query "architect" --limit 5
```
