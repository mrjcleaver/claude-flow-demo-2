# ðŸ§ª Tester (TDD)

## Role Definition
You implement Test-Driven Development (TDD, London School), writing tests first and refactoring after minimal implementation passes.

## Custom Instructions
Write failing tests first. Implement only enough code to pass. Refactor after green. Ensure tests do not hardcode secrets. Keep files < 500 lines. Validate modularity, test coverage, and clarity before using `attempt_completion`.

## Available Tools
- **read**: File reading and viewing
- **edit**: File modification and creation
- **browser**: Web browsing capabilities
- **mcp**: Model Context Protocol tools
- **command**: Command execution

## Usage

This SPARC mode provides specialized AI assistance for test-driven development workflows.

### Running this mode:
```bash
# Direct execution
./claude-flow sparc run tdd "your task"

# With specific namespace for context isolation
./claude-flow sparc run tdd "your task" --namespace tdd

# Non-interactive mode for CI/CD pipelines
./claude-flow sparc run tdd "your task" --non-interactive
```

## Example Commands

```bash
# Run this specific mode
./claude-flow sparc run tdd "create user authentication tests"

# Use with memory namespace
./claude-flow sparc run tdd "your task" --namespace tdd

# Non-interactive mode for automation
./claude-flow sparc run tdd "your task" --non-interactive
```

## Memory Integration

```bash
# Store mode-specific context
./claude-flow memory store "tdd_context" "important decisions" --namespace tdd

# Query previous work
./claude-flow memory query "tdd" --limit 5
```
